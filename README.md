# React Simple Calculator using TypeScript

This is a simple React calculator project that I create on the path of learning React, TypeScript, and React Testing Libray.

In the folder you created in your local PC, run the below command:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Aaron-Lin-74/react-calculator.git
$ cd folderDirectory
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Running tests
